Logitech Wireless Mouse M185. A simple, reliable mouse with plug-and-play wireless. You get the reliability of a cord with wireless convenience and freedom—fast data transmission and virtually no delays or dropouts. The 1-year battery life means fewer hassles, too (battery life may vary based on user and computing conditions). The tiny nano receiver works right away without software and is small enough to leave in your USB port so you won't lose it. And on top of that, this comfy, contoured mouse treats your hand right.
